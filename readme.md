## 🗃️ Dataset Overview

* **Source:** [Kaggle: Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
* **Description:** A dataset containing 7,043 customer records with 21 attributes, including demographic data, subscribed services, account information, and the target variable, `Churn`.

## 📈 All Visualizations & Key Insights

This section provides a complete visual narrative of the exploratory data analysis, with each chart uncovering a different facet of customer churn behavior.

### 1. Overall Churn Distribution
The analysis begins by establishing the baseline churn rate. The dataset is imbalanced, with **26.5%** of customers having churned. This imbalance informs our choice of evaluation metrics like ROC AUC.

### 2. Demographic Analysis
**Insight:** While gender is not a factor, **Senior Citizens churn at a higher rate**. Having a partner and dependents appears to be a stabilizing factor, significantly reducing the likelihood of churn.

### 3. Contract Term Impact on Churn
**Insight:** This is the most significant predictor. Customers on **Month-to-Month contracts have an extremely high churn rate (over 40%)** compared to those on one or two-year contracts, who are far more loyal.

### 4. Billing and Payment Method Analysis
**Insight:** Customers using **Paperless Billing** and paying via **Electronic Check** are significantly more likely to churn. This may indicate dissatisfaction with the digital billing process or issues related to this specific payment method.

### 5. Service Subscription Analysis
**Insight:** Customers **without Online Security, Online Backup, and Tech Support services are far more vulnerable to churn**. Conversely, having these protective services acts as a strong retention factor. The type of internet service also matters, with **Fiber optic customers churning more often** than DSL users.

### 6. Tenure Impact on Churn
**Insight:** Churn is heavily skewed towards **new customers**. The first few months are critical, as the churn rate is highest for customers with low tenure. Loyalty builds over time.

### 7. Correlation Heatmap of Features
**Insight:** The heatmap confirms the strong relationships identified earlier. **Tenure and Contract type have a strong negative correlation with Churn**, while Monthly Charges has a positive correlation.

### 8. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis
**Insight:** An analysis of Customer Lifetime Value reveals that churning customers are often those with lower long-term value. However, the model can be used to prioritize retention efforts on **high-CLV customers who are flagged as high-risk**, maximizing the financial impact of the retention strategy.

## 🎯 Final Model Performance

The XGBoost Classifier delivered the best performance, validating the insights from our EDA.

* **ROC AUC Score:** **0.89**. This indicates a very high capability to distinguish between churning and non-churning customers.
* **Confusion Matrix:** The model correctly identifies a significant number of true churners while maintaining high overall accuracy, making it a reliable tool for business action.
